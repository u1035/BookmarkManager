# BookmarkManager
Standalone desktop application to store browser bookmarks

I often making experiments with Windows, sometimes install other OS, change browsers (and use different kind of broswers, like TOR) and I don't like browser extensions for managing bookmarks. So I want to create application for saving my bookmarks in it, and opening links from it. It should have settings and bookmarks database file in application folder and be portable. Maybe it should be able to make backups. Maybe it should (in future) be cross-platform, and work both on Windows and Linux.
